# Notes

* The US Census Bureau does not have data for religion, as it is not permitted for them to ask: https://ask.census.gov/prweb/PRServletCustom?pyActivity=pyMobileSnapStart&ArticleID=KCP-5050
* PPRI has the "most detailed estimates of American religious affiliation since the U.S. Census Bureau last collected religious data in 1957" in their [2020 Census of American Religion](https://www.prri.org/press-release/prri-releases-groundbreaking-2020-census-of-american-religion/). However, the raw data for this report does not seem to be released yet.
